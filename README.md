# Cyclistic-Case-Study
Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike.
